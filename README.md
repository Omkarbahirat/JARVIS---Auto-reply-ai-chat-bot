# JARVIS---Auto-reply-ai-chat-bot
JARVIS is a simple voice-activated assistant built with Python. It uses speech recognition to detect the wake word “Jarvis” and text-to-speech (TTS) to respond with a human-like voice. Once activated, JARVIS can execute spoken commands such as opening websites or performing basic tasks.
